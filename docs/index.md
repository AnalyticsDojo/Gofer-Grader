# okgrade documentation

`okgrade` is a subset of [okpy](http://okpy.org/) that only does grading.

This library can be used to **autograde** Jupyter Notebooks and
Python files.

Instructors can write tests in a subset of the [okpy test format](docs/ok-test-format.md)
(other formats coming soon), and students can dynamically check if their
code is correct or not. These notebooks / .py files can later
be collected and a grade assigned to them automatically.
