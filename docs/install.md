# Installing Gofer Grader

Gofer Grader can be installed from git directly for now.

```bash
pip install gofer-grader
```

Since both this package and the [okpy](https://pypi.org/project/okpy/) package
provide a package named `client`, you **should not** have both of them installed
in the same environment!

## Requirements

gradememaybe currently requires Python 3.6. If required, we could also
support Python 3.5.

Python 2.7 support is not planned.
